  <h3>About me!</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Justin and here is a little about myself. I live in Washington State in the Seattle area, I joined the Army right out of high school and spent 10 years as a combat medic. In addition to medic training I also trained to jump out of airplanes! I deployed twice to Afghanistan where I was awarded the purple heart.</p>

    <p>After I left the Army I tried staying in the medical field and worked in a couple Phyiscal Therapy clinics as the Office Coordinator. It was not fulfilling enough for me and I left to persue something more challenging and rewarding. Thats when I learned about Epicodus from a close friend who had attended a few years prior. After picking her brain and asking all I could about it I decided that this would be a fit for me and enrolled!</p>
