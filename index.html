  <h3 class="about-me-title"><strong>About me!</strong></h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Justin and here is a little about myself. I live in Washington State in the Seattle area, I joined the Army right out of high school and spent 10 years as a combat medic. In addition to medic training I also trained to jump out of airplanes! I deployed twice to Afghanistan where I was awarded the purple heart.</p>

    <p>After I left the Army I tried staying in the medical field and worked in a couple Phyiscal Therapy clinics as the Office Coordinator. It was not fulfilling enough for me and I left to persue something more challenging and rewarding. Thats when I learned about Epicodus from a close friend who had attended a few years prior. After picking her brain and asking all I could about it I decided that this would be a fit for me and enrolled!</p>

    <p>I am currently engaged to my wonderful fiance Samantha
    <span class="highlight">(pictured above).</span> I also have a 6 year old son, Jamison. We are planning our wedding for May of 2023! We are also planning my sons first trip to Disneyland around Christmas 2022!</p>
